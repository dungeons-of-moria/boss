# BOSS: Beyond Moria 2.40

This repository contains the VMS Pascal source code for the Boss Moria
roguelike game, as developed by Robert Gulledge and Jason Black at the
University of Washington, sometime around 1991.

This is a variant of the original Moria game written by Robert Alan Koeneke.


## Summary

BOSS is a new offspring of the popular dungeon adventure game Moria. Where
Moria involves swords, dragons, and sorcery, BOSS is is a semi-futuristic game
with a twisted sense of humor. While playing, your character will battle evil
scientists, psychotic gang members, hideous mutants, vicious aliens, and the
Boss himself. The goal of defeating the Boss is obtained only after exploring
the chaotic system of tunnels that exist below eight cities overrun by the
Boss's minions.

BOSS differs from Moria (and Imoria) in many ways. Many of these differences
are very obvious, but some may take awhile to be discovered. Major differences
include: fewer races, different classes, lack of "magic", multiple cities, and
less overall time committment needed to fully explore and maybe win the game.

Good luck playing BOSS and most importantly, have fun!
